# Outline

General layout: landscape A1, divided into six boxes; title in top-middle

Target audience: people who might want to do things with tree sequences in python

Proposed collaboration structure:
each box is a jupyter notebook that I put in latex at the last moment

# Title box

- tskit logo
- very brief intro/description statement
- what's on the website
- emphasize that (a) it does stuff fast and quick, and (b) it gives us a time dimension
    * tagline: "launching your genomes into the time dimension"?
- how to contribute
- bigger ecosystem: what else uses tskit?

# Visualization

pretty and useful things

# Exploring/iterating over trees

e.g., "find the trees with at least five nodes above time 100" or "compute the average number of siblings of <something something>"

# input/output and metadata

top-level metadata for all your recording needs

VCF from subsets/masks

# statistics, descriptors

pi-along-the-genome, IBD blocks; cross-coalescent rates?

# operations on tree sequences and interoperability

union and parallelization

decapitation, split edges, etc?

interaction with relate?
