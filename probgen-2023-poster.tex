%%% Each box has a name and can be placed absolutely or relatively.
%%% The only inconvenience is that you can only specify a relative position 
%%% towards an already declared box. So if you have a box attached to the 
%%% bottom, one to the top and a third one which should be inbetween, you 
%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle 
%%% box.

- very brief intro/description statement
- what's on the website
- emphasize that (a) it does stuff fast and quick, and (b) it gives us a time dimension
    * tagline: "launching your genomes into the time dimension"?
- how to contribute
- bigger ecosystem: what else uses tskit?

    \item color elements, e.g. to highlight branches that change between trees
    \item transform elements e.g. rotate labels, alter node symbols, even 3D effects!
    \item timescale titles show time units by default (can also be linear, log, or rank)
    \item interaction possible via mouseover events and javascript animation
