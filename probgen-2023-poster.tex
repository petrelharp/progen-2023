%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    \tskit{} now has integrated metadata
    for all objects (genomes, mutations, sites, etc).
    For instance \emph{(spoiler alert)},
    the complete ARG for 1.26 million SARS-Cov-2 genomes: fits in 57MB!
    Loads in under 1 second!

\begin{minted}{bash}
ls -lh SARS-Cov-2-ARG.ts.tsz
\end{minted}
{\scriptsize \verb|-rw-rw-r-- 1 jk jk 57M Mar  2 13:32 SARS-Cov-2-ARG.ts.tsz|}
\begin{minted}{python}
ts = tszip.decompress("SARS-Cov-2-ARG.ts.tsz")
\end{minted}
{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
CPU times: user 775 ms, sys: 533 ms, total: 1.31 s
Wall time: 842 ms
\end{verbatim}
}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sc2_ts.png}

\paragraph{The integrated data model}
links nodes, edges, sites and mutations,
and now allows annotation of all objects with arbitrary external metadata.
For instance,
here's the first five sites in the SARS-Cov-2 ARG,
and all three mutations at the first site:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{minted}{python}
ts.tables.sites[:5]
\end{minted}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sc2_sites}

\begin{minted}{python}
ts.tables.mutations[ts.mutations_site == 0]
\end{minted}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{sc2_muts}
\end{multicols}

All the information \tskit{} knows about can be accessed
as dictionaries.
Here's one of the samples:

We aim to provide \emph{stable}, \emph{well-tested} and \emph{well-documented}
software so others can reliably build with it --
including a \emph{backwards compatibility} guarantee.
\tskit{} is already being used in a number of inference and simulation packages.
The core functionality is implemented via a C API,
and the primary interface is via a Python library,
but others are available:

\begin{itemize} \compresslist
    \item Well-tested API used by many software packages: SLiM, fwdpy11, msprime, tsinfer/tsdate, Relate, slendr, etc.
    \item Available in multiple programming languages:

        \includegraphics[width=2em]{RustLogo}
        \includegraphics[width=2em]{R-logo}
    \item Runs in-browser (no install required!) for quick demos / teaching (see screenshot).
    \item Can represent full Ancestral Recombination Graphs; includes ARG likelihood calculations.
    \item Interoperable with other packages (e.g., VCF output for sequence data, newick/nexus output to Dendropy, numpy arrays to scikit-allel)
\end{itemize}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\tskit{} is the C and python library providing tools for working with \emph{succinct tree sequences}.
We provide solid, stable, well-tested software for you to use and build on.
Why might you want to use tree sequences?
\begin{itemize} \compresslist
    \item For large samples,
        stores genotypes losslessly using (possibly estimated) underlying genealogical relationships
        in orders of magnitude less space,
    \item \ldots and allows fast processing and exploration: wait seconds, not hours.
    \item Genealogical relationships -- ``the trees'' -- are often closer to
        things we want to learn about
    \item \ldots and explicitly include a \emph{time dimension}.
    \item History of a process can be recorded in a simulation, not just the genotypic outcome,
    \item \ldots and simulations can be much faster/more efficient.
\end{itemize}

In summary:
by representing genomes using the genealogical process that generated the data,
we get both a huge advantage storing and manipulating genomic data,
as well as a more direct look at the processes that generated the data.

Here's some \textbf{silly slogans}, care to suggest any more?

    \item ``\tskit: launching your genomes into the time dimension!''
    \item ``\tskit: tree thinking, for popgen''
    \item ``\tskit: stable software for genome-scale trees''
    \item ``\tskit: all your insights, much faster!''

\begin{posterbox}[name=stats,column=3,row=0,span=1]{Statistics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\tskit{} lets you perform efficient calculations of statistics along the genome, often many times quicker than other software! You may be interested in calculating:

\begin{itemize} \compresslist
    \item the allele frequency spectrum or statistics derived from it,
        like nucleotide diversity, Tajima's $D$, f4, \ldots
    \item IBD-based quantities,
    \item summaries of tree topology,
        e.g., genealogical nearest neighbours and tree balance metrics,
    \item cross-coalescence rates (coming soon!)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example:} newly-implemented tree balance statistics. A balanced
(binary) tree is perfectly symmetric in some way: each node has an equally
sized subtree descending from its left- and right- branches, where `size'
is determined by some metric involving the tree's nodes and edges. \tskit{}
now implements several different metrics to calculate how unbalanced each
tree is:

\begin{minted}{python}
imb = pd.DataFrame({
    "genomic position" : [t.interval[0] for t in ts.trees()],
    "b1" : [t.b1_index() for t in ts.trees()],
    "b2" : [t.b2_index() for t in ts.trees()],
    "colless" : [t.colless_index() for t in ts.trees()],
    "sackin" : [t.sackin_index() for t in ts.trees()]
}).set_index("genomic position")

imb = ((imb - imb.mean()) / imb.std())
imb.plot(figsize=(16, 4), alpha=0.7)
\end{minted}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    % \emph{Example notebook: \url{https://github.com/petrelharp/progen-2023/new-features.ipynb}}

\tskit{}'s contributors are diverse and prolific! We are actively working on
    new features, bug fixes, and improvements to the usability of existing
    features. Here's a shortlist of some recent additions:

\paragraph{Reference sequences}
By default, the sites in a tree sequence only define ancestral nucleotides at
    polymorphism sites. Remaining positions can now be specified using the
    \texttt{TreeSequence.reference\_sequence}, and individual sample alignments can
    be obtained with the new \texttt{TreeSequence.alignments()} iterator.

\paragraph{Structural operations}
We've expanded the set of utility functions for large edits on tree sequences.
    For instance, the \texttt{TreeSequence.decapitate} method removes all parts of a
    tree sequence that are older than some user-specified time,
    and \texttt{TreeSequence.union} allows joining together of separate tree sequences
    to allow parallel simulation across different branches of a phylogenetic tree.

\paragraph{Efficient array access}
The relationships between nodes in each tree can now be extracted as \texttt{numpy}
    arrays. When used in conjunction with \texttt{numba},
    Python-based calculations on the trees can act as speedily as
    machine-level code. Consider these calculations of total branch length on
    trees of different sizes:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{minted}{python}
@numba.njit
def _total_branch_length(preorder, parent, node_time):
     tbl = 0
     for u in preorder:
          if parent[u] != -1:
               tbl += node_time[parent[u]] - node_time[u]
     return tbl

def get_total_branch_length(tree):
     return _total_branch_length( tree.preorder(), tree.parent_array,
                tree.tree_sequence.nodes_time)
\end{minted}
